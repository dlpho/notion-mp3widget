Ding-a-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling
Boo-ba-doo-ba-doop
Boo-ba-doo-ba-doop
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring
Banana phone
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring
Banana phone
I've got this feeling, so appealing
For us to get together and sing, sing
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring banana phone
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong, ding donana phone
It grows in bunches, I've got my hunches
It's the best, beats the rest
Cellular, modular, interactivodular
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring banana phone
Boop-boo-ba-doo-ba-doop
Ping-pong, ping-pong, ping-pong, ping panana phone
It's no baloney, it ain't a phony
My cellular bananular phone
Don't need quarters, don't need dimes
To call a friend of mine
Don't need computer or TV
To have a real good time
I'll call for pizza, I'll call my cat
I'll call the White House, have a chat
I'll place a call around the world, operator get me Beijing-jing-jing-jing
Yeah
Play that thing
Whoo-ho
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring banana phone
Boop-boo-ba-doo-ba-doop
Yin-yang, yin-yang, yin-yang, yin-yonana phone
It's a real live mama and papa phone
A brother and sister and a dog-a-phone
A grandpa phone and a grandma phone too, oh yeah
My cellular, bananular phone
Banana phone, ring, ring, ring
(It's a phone with a peel)
Banana phone, ring, ring, ring
(Now you can have your phone and eat it too)
Banana phone, ring, ring, ring
(This song drives me bananas)
Banana phone, ring, ring, ring
Boo-ba-doo-ba-doop-doop-doop
